# Welcome to BookChat App!
Join one of the rooms and chat away.

This is a chat application created with React and Scaledrone. Along with React router, Valtio for state management, React Bootstrap and SCSS for styling.
It was created as a place for book lovers to chat away anything related to books and reading.


## Some of the functionalities:
- **Homepage**
  - with option to go to the login page or see the source code
- **Login page**
  - in which an user should input username and select a room in order to join the cat (multiple rooms are available)
- **Chat page** (that's where a big part of the magic happens)
  - room name is displayed in the header
  - logout button is hidden and set aside, redirects user to homepage
  - list of active users displays on off canvas
  - input field with option to insert text and/or emojis
  - message display, of course (containing username, avatar generated with random colors, and message text; messages are displayed right or left based on who sent it)


This app can do some things, but there are a lot of ideas going on. So in due time, there will probably be some updates. :D

Default info about Create React App


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
